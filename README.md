# CSCI 4210 Project 4 Fall 2015

###Usage:
The code is written in Python 2.7.x. Run *server.py* in server terminal. An Ubuntu server is recommended because some features such as binary file store/read is not supported in Windows environment.

The preferred test way is using the _netcat_ command in Linux terminal. A default **8765** port is set in *server.py*. The *client.py* code is not fully compatible with the code because the recv() command will block the communication.
